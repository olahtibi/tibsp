# tibsp
This is a pure functional programming language similar to LISP.

Demo: https://olahtibi.github.io/tibsp/

The goal of this project is to create a minimal as possible core language that is sufficiently expressive to write libraries in the language itself. The libraries themselves could include their own unit tests.

Example: https://github.com/olahtibi/tibsp/blob/master/tibsp.stdlib.js
