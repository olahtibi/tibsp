# tibsp
This is a pure functional programming language similar to LISP.
Interpreted in javascript and runs inside the browser.

Demo: https://olahtibi.github.io/tibsp/

The goal of this project is to create a minimal as possible core language that is sufficiently expressive to write libraries in the language itself. The libraries themselves could include their own unit tests.
